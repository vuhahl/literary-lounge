	<h2 >Welcome to my chunk of the Internet ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ </h2>
        <p><em>Welcome</em> to my little library, where I share my love for books and all things literature!</p>
        <p>Here, I keep a catalogue about everything related to reading.</p>
        <p>As an avid reader, I believe that books have the power to transport us to new worlds, introduce us to new perspectives, and enrich our lives.
        I just wanted a virtual space to share my passion for reading, log my book favorites and get new recommendations!
        </p>
    <p> Enjoy! ( ˘▽˘)っ♨ </p>

                 <p> A novel of terrible first impressions, hilarious second chances, and the joy in finding your perfect match.
                     Dr. Briana Ortiz’s life is seriously flatlining. Her divorce is just about finalized, her brother’s running out of time to find a kidney donor,
                     and that promotion she wants? Oh, that’s probably going to the new man-doctor who’s already registering eighty-friggin’-seven on Briana’s “pain in my ass” scale. But just when all systems are set to hate,
                     Dr. Jacob Maddox completely flips the game . . . by sending Briana a letter. And it’s a really good letter.
                     Like the kind that proves that Jacob isn’t actually Satan. Worse, he might be this fantastically funny and subversively likeable guy who’s terrible at first impressions.
                     Because suddenly he and Bri are exchanging letters, sharing lunch dates in her “sob closet,” and discussing the merits of freakishly tiny horses.
                     But when Jacob decides to give Briana the best gift imaginable—a kidney for her brother—she wonders just how she can resist this new doctor . . .
                     especially when he calls in a favor she can’t refuse.
